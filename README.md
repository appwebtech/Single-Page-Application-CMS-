# Introduction

Released in 2003 Wordpress (WP) has evolved tremendously and now has become one of the best web technologies in building generic websites. 
At the time of writing, WP powers close to 75 million websites. So what is WP anyway? 

WP is a CMS that uses plugins, themes etc to enhance the functionality and usability within a website. It runs PHP in the BackEnd and HTML5 and CSS3. For the designers/developers who love to code less and output more SASS comes in really handy when coding locally via a private server; configurations can easily be used via XAMPP which runs Apache, PHP and MySQL, and you get direct access to your files via sublime, atom or whichever text editor is your favorite.  

Many blog designers do use WP CMS due to it's versatility and UX/UI customizability. When designing [this](http://kenyamanenos.com) blog for instance, my intention was to have the user access trending news via a UXD/UED adherent platform. This would not only enhance the brand loyalty but would improve usability and ease of access across multi platforms. 

As technology advances, many firms are turning to online marketing for conversion rates. The reason is because many people are connected to the internet and still many more will be connected in future. The ability of mobile devices to accomodate HQ/HD images has had a huge impact in the marketing industry. 4K, 5K Ultra HD and the introduction of Retina screens is only the tip of the iceberg of the transformations we are yet to witness.

There is a reason as to why [Nike](http://www.nike.com/gb/en_gb/), [Cocacola](https://us.coca-cola.com/home/), [Katy Perry](http://www.katyperry.com/), [Jay Z](http://lifeandtimes.com/), [Beyoncè](http://www.beyonce.com/), [Android](https://www.android.com/), [Apple](http://www.apple.com/), [Ford](http://www.ford.com/) etc, use single page applications with parallax, ultra, float, peak or even split designs for their websites. I have used parallax design concept to create this mock-up. The conversion rates speak for themselves. They close more sales than other designs and above all, they are responsive. 

As time passes, trends will change to more inclusive designs which favor innovative technological advancements of the time. In virtue of that observation I'll use this priviledge as granted by [GitHub Cloud Services](https://cloud.github.com/) and [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com/home) (who have greatly enhanced software engineering) to add some captions of what the said web apps above are using as at the time of writing.

As design trends change, marketing concepts are been inculcated online to enhance both customer and product centricity; although many a company claim to lean more on the former, the latter has been much more evident due to the upselling tactics employed. 

Whilst taking [Marketing](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/3U94GKSQ3L) course in the Business Foundations Specialization at [The Wharton School](https://online.wharton.upenn.edu/), I learned that consumer behavior and psychology will always go hand in hand with **Commoditization** (technology-enabled product development), **Smart customers** (technology-enabled information ﬂow) and other product centric approaches like **Retail saturation** and **Product virality** (fame/trendy/cool/stylish). See [Viral Marketing and How to Craft Contagious Content](https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-contagious-viral-marketing).

The optimal or equilibrium point of **customer centricity vs product centricity** can be measured with [Google Analytics Data (GAD)](https://www.google.com/analytics/#?modal_active=none) if plotted as a function between customers reached and their satisfied needs. Insights in value chain disruption, collaborative consumption, matching of supply and demand, together with democratization in access can also be estimated with GAD. 

By bringing your product or service to your target audience in a catchy professionally designed web application, you not only enhance your **customer intimacy** (customer responsiveness) but you **differentiate** yourself from your competitors creating **performance superiority/seniority**; and that will automatically trigger **operational excellence** (competence).

Wordpress is an open-source [Content Management System (CMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress) that uses [Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) for its BackEnd (server-side) system and [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) to manage it's databases (DB). PHP is a server-side scripting language which is amazing in web development; this is due to it's flexibility to be embedded in [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), more or less the way [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails) is embedded in Rails. PHP is very versatile and compatible across many browsers, web servers and operating systems. The preference of using it for server-side systems has grown and will continue due to it's de-facto pro-bono policy. Same applies to MySQL.

Wordpress uses MySQL to manage it's DB's and PHP renders data from the server to the frontend. MySQL is an RDBMS and most of it's functionalities are open-source. It's a main component of [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) open-source web application software stack. 

Below is a snapshot of the DB I used. It can be queried, searched and exported to other servers.

There are a myriad of reason as to why I love using open-source software in design and development. Compelling advatanges gravitate towards the following factors which are quite intuitive;
* Security
* Customizability
* Freedom
* Auditability
* Ready Support (Bug fixes are timely)
* Try and discard if you dont like.
* Quality etc etc


# Why Wordpress?

WP is versatile in building CMS's for web publishing especially, blogs, single web application's, landing pages, simple websites, etc. Themes and plugins within the WP ecosystem enhance the design process and development saving time and at the same time delivering professional products. Although WP has it's limits, it is a great CMS for web development.

As an open-source technology product, bugs within the WP CMS are fixed in a timely manner and developer/designer contributions towards the platform are encouraged through the [WP GitHub portal](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress).

Other CMS's like [Joomla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joomla) and [Drupal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal) are fantastic but WP beats them all due to the massive global community, plugins and themes. Some advanced technical sophistication would be required for Joomla and Drupal CMS's so to speak. 
 

# Technologies & Design Methodology


## Parallax

Parallax Engine that reacts to the orientation of a smart device. Where no gyroscope or motion detection hardware is available, the position of the cursor is used instead.

### Setup

Create a list of elements giving each item that you want to move within your parallax scene a class of `layer` and a `data-depth` attribute specifying its depth within the scene. A depth of **0** will cause the layer to remain stationary, and a depth of **1** will cause the layer to move by the total effect of the calculated motion. Values inbetween **0** and **1** will cause the layer to move by an amount relative to the supplied ratio.

```html
<ul id="scene">
  <li class="layer" data-depth="0.00"><img src="layer1.png"></li>
  <li class="layer" data-depth="0.20"><img src="layer2.png"></li>
  <li class="layer" data-depth="0.40"><img src="layer3.png"></li>
  <li class="layer" data-depth="0.60"><img src="layer4.png"></li>
  <li class="layer" data-depth="0.80"><img src="layer5.png"></li>
  <li class="layer" data-depth="1.00"><img src="layer6.png"></li>
</ul>
```

To kickoff a **Parallax** scene, select your parent DOM Element and pass it to the **Parallax** constructor.

```javascript
var scene = document.getElementById('scene');
var parallax = new Parallax(scene);
```

## Understanding Layer Motion Calculations

The amount of motion that each layer moves by depends on 3 contributing factors:

1. The `scalarX` and `scalarY` values (see [Behaviours](#behaviours) below for configuration)
2. The dimensions of the parent DOM element
3. The `depth` of a layer within a parallax scene (specified by it's `data-depth` attribute)

The calculation for this motion is as follows:

```coffeescript
xMotion = parentElement.width  * (scalarX / 100) * layerDepth
yMotion = parentElement.height * (scalarY / 100) * layerDepth
```

So for a layer with a `data-depth` value of `0.5` within a scene that has both the `scalarX` and `scalarY` values set to `10` ( *the default* ) where the containing scene element is `1000px x 1000px`, the total motion of the layer in both `x` and `y` would be:

```coffeescript
xMotion = 1000 * (10 / 100) * 0.5 = 50 # 50px of positive and negative motion in x
yMotion = 1000 * (10 / 100) * 0.5 = 50 # 50px of positive and negative motion in y
```

### Behaviours

There are a number of behaviours that you can setup for any given **Parallax** instance. These behaviours can either be specified in the markup via data attributes or in JavaScript via the constructor and API.

| Behaviour           | Values              | Default       | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `relativeInput`     | `true` or `false`   | `false`       | Specifies whether or not to use the coordinate system of the `element` passed to the parallax `constructor`. **Mouse input only.**                   |
| `clipRelativeInput` | `true` or `false`   | `false`       |  Specifies whether or not to clip the mouse input to the bounds of the `element` passed to the parallax `constructor`. **Mouse input only.**          |
| `calibrate-x`       | `true` or `false`   | `false`       | Specifies whether or not to cache & calculate the motion relative to the initial `x` axis value on initialisation.                                   |
| `calibrate-y`       | `true` or `false`   | `true`        | Specifies whether or not to cache & calculate the motion relative to the initial `y` axis value on initialisation.                                   |
| `invert-x`          | `true` or `false`   | `true`        | `true` moves layers in opposition to the device motion, `false` slides them away.                                                                    |
| `invert-y`          | `true` or `false`   | `true`        | `true` moves layers in opposition to the device motion, `false` slides them away.                                                                    |
| `limit-x`           | `number` or `false` | `false`       | A numeric value limits the total range of motion in `x`, `false` allows layers to move with complete freedom.                                        |
| `limit-y`           | `number` or `false` | `false`       | A numeric value limits the total range of motion in `y`, `false` allows layers to move with complete freedom.                                        |
| `scalar-x`          | `number`            | `10.0`        | Multiplies the input motion by this value, increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of the layer motion.                                             |
| `scalar-y`          | `number`            | `10.0`        | Multiplies the input motion by this value, increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of the layer motion.                                             |
| `friction-x`        | `number` `0 - 1`    | `0.1`         | The amount of friction the layers experience. This essentially adds some easing to the layer motion.                                                 |
| `friction-y`        | `number` `0 - 1`    | `0.1`         | The amount of friction the layers experience. This essentially adds some easing to the layer motion.                                                 |
| `origin-x`          | `number`            | `0.5`         | The `x` origin of the mouse input. Defaults to 0.5 (the center). `0` moves the origin to the left edge, `1` to the right edge. **Mouse input only.** |
| `origin-y`          | `number`            | `0.5`         | The `y` origin of the mouse input. Defaults to 0.5 (the center). `0` moves the origin to the top edge, `1` to the bottom edge. **Mouse input only.** |
| `precision`         | `integer`           | `1`           | Decimals the element positions should be rounded to. Changing this value should not be necessary anytime soon.                                       |
| `pointerEvents`     | `true` or `false`   | `true`        | Setting this to false might increase the performance in some instances, while removing pointer events for the scene - eg, Links are not clickable    |

In addition to the behaviours described above, there are **two** methods `enable()` and `disable()` that *activate* and *deactivate* the **Parallax** instance respectively.

## Google Maps Widget

### Description
Bring the world into your application, with the Google Maps widget!

### Typical usage scenario

Giving a visual representation of an address.
Showing an overview where all your branches/members/clients/orders/etc. are.
 
### Features and limitations
Tap directly into all the power of Google Maps.
Easy to implement.
No route planning or advanced features yet.

### Dependencies
Mendix 5.x Environment

### Configuration
One of the most important things to keep in mind when implementing this widget is the Google Maps terms of use. These can be found here: Terms of Use. [Chapter 9.1 is especially important](https://developers.google.com/maps/terms#9-license-requirements).

        Free, Public Accessibility to Your Maps API Implementation. Your Maps API Implementation must be generally accessible to users without charge. You may require users to log in to your Maps API Implementation if you do not require users to pay a fee. U nless you have entered into a separate written agreement with Google or obtained Google's written permission , your Maps API Implementation must not:

        (a) require a fee-based subscription or other fee-based restricted access; or
        (b) operate only behind a firewall or only on an internal network (except during the development and testing phase).


There are 3 use-cases for which this widget can be used.

        Outside a dataview: Will just retrieve the objects specified and show them on the map.
        Inside a dataview not matching the Objects property: Will show the objects specified, can use '[%CurrentObject%]' in XPath Constraint.
        Inside a dataview matching the Objects property: Will show the objects specified, can NOT use '[%CurrentObject%]'. Can set up the dataview to listen to a matching datagrid. If 'Pan to context' is set to true, it will focus on the marker of the object that is selected in the datagrid.

To finish up, just enter the correct values into the widget. For more information on the different input properties, read below.

### Maps API Access Key

The Google Maps Javascript API v3 does not require an API key to function properly. However, I have loaded the Maps API using an APIs Console key which will allow the webmaster / site administrator to monitor the application's Maps API usage.

### Authentications

Google JavaScript API do need authentications. I have a premium plan and thus enjoy two authentication options. 
  - **API key** set up in the Google Maps APIs 
  - **Client ID** instead of an API key.
I always encourage clients to get a private API instead of using APIS's from a developer for many reasons which are beyond the scope of this documentation. 

Many developers also turn out as site admins after delivering projects enjoying some special perks for website maintenance. Having a private API key, you can log in and see what's happening instead of relying on what someone else is saying. (Remember the old adage? **Trust but Verify.**)

You can have multiple lightboxes on one page, if you give them different selectors. Here is a small example:

## PHP

This website uses PHP as it's backend system for it's database and server client functionalties. The beauty of PHP is it's ability to be embedded with HTML. The server in this website uses CGI protocol to process PHP code and render the website functionalities. 

## jQuery

jQuery is a Javascript library that enhances script composition from the designer/developer coding environment. It's super fast and amazing at event handling, animation, document traversal, Ajax and if you write API's constantly, then jQuery can come in handy instead of using vanilla javascript.

It's DOM element selection has lead to insights in creating other javascript frameworks tailored at specific needs. It has many contributors with over 6000 commits on it's GitHub page at the time of writing, and big multinationals like Nokia and Microsoft bundle it on their platforms eg ASP.NET, AJAX, Visual Studio etc.

Using jQuery to code has been very rewarding as it solves many a problem with less pain saving a lot of time and thus enhancing productivity in the long run.


## Photoshop

It's no doubt that Adobe Photoshop remains the best raster graphics editor on the planet. It's ability to use RGB, CMYK, duotone, etc coupled with the great variety of image extensions makes it the best option to edit images professionally. 

I have extensive experience in PSD design even prior to my web development career. I used it in this project for image sizing and for enhancing vivid display accross platforms from smart tv's to smart phones. I have targeted large images for big displays like desktops whilst small displays have images of reduced dimensions in pixels.

I tweak images to ensure that pixels are not lost when switching viewports and that the image extensions like **.jpeg** and **.png** are well saved to curb image degradation. 

## Deployment instructions

Deploy to a server which supports WP like Godaddy, HostGator etc. HostGator is more speedy in loading pages imo than other websites.

In most cases I code locally and later upload to my cPanel. I will try andupload this website and fight the urge of pulling it down. (For some reason many people buy demo websites and request that they get pulled down. Let's cross fingures to thwart that.)
